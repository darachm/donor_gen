# donor_gen
It makes donor plasmid cells from annotated gene fragments. 
Packages needed : Biopython 
Can either pip install biopython on terminal or if you have anaconda, you can install it from there within your environment. 
I recommend creating a virtual environment and using that environment to run your code but thats not necessary.
